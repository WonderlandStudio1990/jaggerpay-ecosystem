- WebSocket setup (if applicable)
- State management

### 6. Environment Configuration
- Environment variable management
- Secret handling
- Configuration validation
- Development/staging/production differences

### 7. Performance
- Build time optimization
- Runtime performance
- Caching strategies
- Resource utilization

## Current Issues
1. Docker build fails with TypeScript errors
2. Environment variables not properly loaded
3. Test execution issues in Docker
4. Frontend-backend connection problems
5. Dependency conflicts
6. Type definition mismatches

## Expected Outcome
